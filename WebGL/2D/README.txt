-For this lab I created an ellipse, square, and a hexagon. 
-Each shape has its own function
-All initializations were handled in a seperate init() function.
-I used uniform coloring and then changed each shapes color using uniform4f().
-The ellipse and square are using TRIANGLE_FAN, while the hexagon is using LINE_LOOP.
-The circle uses n=100 vertices.

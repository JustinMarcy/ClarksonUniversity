1) When I entered the "man cd" command it opened up the entire manual for bash. This is because
   cd is a bash command. Other commands such as "ls" only display information specific to "ls."
  
2) cp -R ~ee462/public ~marcyjc/ee462/
   Move does not work because you do not have permission to delete or edit the contents of another
   directory without being the administrator. In this case, move does a copy and then deletes.

3) I typed "cd L" which autocompleted to "cd Lab_" and then I typed "3" bringing me to the Lab_3 
   directory.  
   mv FAQ_Linux FAQ/
   mv FAQ_shells FAQ/
   By using FAQ* this moves all files that start with FAQ in that directory. The error is that 
   it will move undesired files. 

   "cat FAQ_Linux" is difficult to read on the terminal because its a lot of content and you 
   cannot edit it. Two alternatives is using a text editor and the file explorer.   

4) cp -r ~justin/EE462/Lab_3/ ~justin/BACKUPS/
   For me, I did not observe a difference when i used the command twice, it did not create 
   duplicate or anything like that. The command to display the directory subtree is the 
   "tree" command. 

5) rm -r BACKUPS/
   The ls command verifies the the directory is no longer there

6) PATH=$PATH:justin/EE462/Lab_3/welcome
   echo PATH$
   echo welcome

7) To Evaluate the current shell: echo $PATH
   /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/
   snap/bin:justin/EE462/Lab_3/welcome

   To Find the value in the subshell I used: echo $BASH_SUBSHELL
   and the value was 0

   In the new terminal its value is different: 
   /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin

8) 

9) The command to find how many users is: who | wc -l 
   This was 25 people
   
   To find out how many times I have logged in I used: last marcyjc 
   This was 4 times

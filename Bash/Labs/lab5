1)

	a) alias mkx='chomod' u+x'

	b) This command will be saved in the .bashrc file

	c) The alias must be defined in the .bashrc because this file is read
	   each time a sub shell is opened. Both .bashrc and .profile are read
	   by login shells but only .bashrc is read when creating a sub shell.

2)

	a) bash forever 10 10000

	b) It spends most of the time sleeping

	c) No, not while the process is running in the foreground

	d) ctrl + c terminates the process and ctrl + z stops the process.

	e) bg

	f) ps [job number]

	g) It still prints to std out but you can also use the terminal for
	   commands.

	h) ctrl + c does not terminate the background process. The job status
	   verifies it is still running. It is also still printing to terminal. 

	i) kill %[job number]

	j) you can just type 'bg' if you just created the prcoess. Otherwise
	   you type bg %[job number]

3)

	a) od -ta numtext

	b) head -7 numtext | tail -5

	c) head -7 numtext | tail -5 > intermediate && cat intermediate > numtext 

4)

	a) sort -k1,1 sorttest
	   It sorts the field in alphabetical order with Capitals before lowercase

	b) sort -k2,2 sorttest
	   The late and new strings are not together because the sort detected a
	   space infront of the string so it sorted based on the empty character.

	c)
	  sort -b -k2,2 sorttest	  
	
       	 field1 field2 field3 field4
	 Now     late    done 5
	 Other   late    done 200
	 yes     late    done 1
	 now     new     end  03
	 other   new     end  20

	 It fixes the problem. 

	d) Just using -b does not fix this for field 4 because of the '03'
	   To fix this, I used the -g option as follows

	   sort -b -g -k4 sorttest
	   
	   field1 field2 field3 field4
	   yes     late    done 1
	   now     new     end  03
	   Now     late    done 5
	   other   new     end  20
	   Other   late    done 200

	    
5)

	a) Inside the usr/include/ directory I typed
	   wc -l *.h

	   FOR SOME REASON, MY USR/INCLUDE/ DIRECTORY ONLY HAS 7 FILES INSIDE OF IT
	   AND THERE IS ONLY 1 HEADER FILE (sudo_plugin.h) Not sure why this is the case,
	   it sounds like this problem requires multiple header files.

	b) Not sure

Question 1)
By switching the roles of the men and women, the outputs will almost always be
different (for larger size groups). This is because the algorithm tends to favor
the gender being asked. For example, if the men ask the women, the women are
more likely to end up with their preferred matches because they are able to
leave a current match of a better proposal comes along.

---------------------------Procedural Specification-----------------------------
In this procedure, it would be best to use an exception rather than returning 0
if an array is empty. Returning 0 is not accurate because an array might sum to
0 anyways, in which the user could not differentiate between empty and sum = 0.

return_type int
//REQUIRES: int[] 
//MODIFIES: N/A
//EFFECTS:  If the input array is empty, throw ArrayIsEmpty exception. Otherwise
            return the sum of the array
